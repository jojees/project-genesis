# 🧪 Testing Strategy

This document outlines the testing strategy for our project, based on a mix of industry practices, research insights, and practical constraints.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of Testing

- Ensure critical business logic functions as expected.
- Catch regressions early in development and CI.
- Provide confidence during refactoring and feature development.
- Serve as living documentation for system behavior.

## 🔍 Types of Tests

| Test Type       | Purpose                                     | When to Use                            |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Unit Tests**   | Validate individual functions/classes       | For critical business logic, edge cases |
| **Integration Tests** | Verify module/component interactions        | Where multiple parts of the system connect |
| **System/End-to-End Tests** | Validate end-user flows and real-world behavior | For high-risk, high-value workflows     |

---

## ✅ Test Coverage Goals

- **No arbitrary % target** (e.g. 100%)—coverage is a vanity metric.
- **Focus coverage on critical logic, edge cases, and business rules.**
- Prefer **broad, moderate coverage** across all modules over perfection in a few.
- Example goal:  
  - All files touched by current feature work should have **reasonable coverage**.
  - Aim for at least **baseline coverage in all modules** (>30–50%) to detect regressions.

---

## 🧱 Testing Guidelines

### 1. **Write High-Value Tests First**
- Focus on areas with:
  - Complex logic
  - Input validation
  - Security, money, or user-sensitive behavior
- Test both **happy paths** and **edge cases**.

### 2. **Don’t Over-Test Trivial Code**
- Avoid writing tests for:
  - Getters/setters
  - Framework boilerplate
  - Plain data transformations unless business-critical

### 3. **Use Integration Tests to Validate Real Behavior**
- Helps catch issues in wiring, misconfigurations, and actual system interactions.
- Gives better insight into "real-world" coverage.

### 4. **TDD (Test-Driven Development) Optional**
- Use when:
  - Designing new modules
  - Working in unfamiliar or high-risk areas
- Avoid blindly following TDD rules; they can lead to low-value test bloat.

---

## 🚫 What We Avoid

- Writing tests solely to chase coverage numbers.
- Over-isolating units with heavy mocking when integration tests suffice.
- Maintaining large numbers of brittle or low-value tests.

---

## 🧪 Testing in Practice

### For New Code:
- Write unit tests for new logic-heavy modules.
- Add integration tests for workflows and API endpoints.
- Ensure CI runs these tests automatically.

### For Legacy Code:
- Add tests as you touch or refactor code.
- Prioritize writing tests around risky or hard-to-reason areas.

## 🧰 Tools & Frameworks

| Purpose            | Tool                      |
|--------------------|---------------------------|
| Unit testing       | e.g., Jest / Pytest / JUnit |
| Integration testing| e.g., Supertest / Requests / Testcontainers |
| Coverage reporting | e.g., Istanbul / Coverage.py |
| CI automation      | e.g., GitHub Actions / GitLab CI |

---

## 🧠 Final Notes

- **The right number of tests** depends on your application’s complexity, risk profile, and longevity.
- Focus on writing **the right tests**, not just more tests.
- Tests are most valuable when they help you move fast **without fear**.
