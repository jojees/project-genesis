## Main Entry Point or App Initializer

For each Python microservice within the `src/` directory, the main entry points are typically:
* `src/*/app.py` (e.g., `src/audit-event-generator/app.py`, `src/event-audit-dashboard/event_audit_dashboard/app.py`)
* `src/*/main.py` (e.g., `src/audit-log-analysis/audit_analysis/main.py`, `src/notification-service/notification_service/main.py`)

These files initialize the respective Flask applications, set up logging, connect to message brokers (RabbitMQ), and interact with databases (Postgres, Redis).

---

## Setup Instructions (High-Level)

The project emphasizes Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and automated deployments. Key setup steps include:

1.  **Prerequisites:** Install Git, Docker, Python 3.9+ with Poetry, Terraform CLI, Ansible, `kubectl`, and Helm CLI.
2.  **Infrastructure Provisioning:**
    * Review and adjust **Terraform configurations** in `infra/terraform/`.
    * Initialize and apply Terraform: `terraform init`, `terraform plan`, `terraform apply -auto-approve`.
    * Configure the **K3s cluster** on provisioned nodes using **Ansible** (update `infra/ansible/inventory/hosts.ini` and run `ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts.ini playbooks/setup-k3s.yaml`).
3.  **Application Deployment:**
    * **Docker Images:** Built and pushed automatically to Docker Hub via GitHub Actions.
    * **Kubernetes Deployment:** Deploy the AuditFlow Platform using **Helm**. Navigate to the main Helm chart directory (e.g., `k8s/charts/events-app`), update dependencies (`helm dependency update`), and install (`helm install auditflow-platform . --namespace auditflow-platform --create-namespace -f values.yaml`).

Detailed instructions are available in the `docs/` directory, particularly `docs/setup.md`.

---

## Usage Instructions

Once deployed to Kubernetes:
* The **`event-audit-dashboard`** service provides a user interface to visualize audit events and alerts. Access will depend on Kubernetes service exposure (e.g., NodePort, LoadBalancer, Ingress).
* Other services (e.g., `audit-event-generator`, `audit-log-analysis`, `notification-service`) run as background processes, interacting via RabbitMQ and storing data in PostgreSQL or Redis.
* Monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana) would be used to observe application health and performance.

---

## Architecture Overview

The `AuditFlow Platform` is an **event-driven, microservice-based application**.
* **`audit_event_generator`**: Produces synthetic audit events.
* **`audit-log-analysis`**: Consumes events from RabbitMQ, performs analysis, and stores results (likely in Postgres or Redis).
* **`event-audit-dashboard`**: A web interface that fetches and displays audit events/alerts.
* **`notification-service`**: Handles alerts and notifications based on analysis outcomes.
* **`PostgreSQL`**: Relational database for persistent storage.
* **`RabbitMQ`**: Central message broker facilitating asynchronous communication between services.
* **`Redis`**: Key-value store for caching or temporary data.

Services communicate primarily via **RabbitMQ**, enabling a decoupled and scalable system. Kubernetes orchestrates these services, ensuring their availability and managing resources.

---

## Explanation of Key Modules/Components

* **`audit-event-generator` (Python Microservice):** Responsible for creating and publishing synthetic audit events to RabbitMQ.
* **`audit-log-analysis` (Python Microservice):** Consumes audit events from RabbitMQ, processes them (e.g., parsing, categorization), and stores the analyzed data. It likely interacts with Redis for temporary data and Postgres for persistent storage.
* **`event-audit-dashboard` (Python Web Application):** Provides a Flask-based web interface for users to visualize the processed audit events and alerts. It retrieves data from the backend services or databases.
* **`notification-service` (Python Microservice):** Subscribes to specific event streams from RabbitMQ or listens for triggers from the `audit-log-analysis` service, sending out notifications (e.g., email, alerts) based on defined rules. It interacts with Postgres for notification-related data.
* **`k8s/base`:** Contains the foundational Kubernetes YAML manifests for each service and infrastructure component (Postgres, RabbitMQ, Redis). These define Deployments, Services, StatefulSets, and PVCs.
* **`infra/terraform`:** Holds Terraform configurations to provision the underlying cloud infrastructure (e.g., VMs for K3s nodes) required for the Kubernetes cluster.
* **`infra/ansible`:** Contains Ansible playbooks to automate the installation and configuration of the K3s cluster on the provisioned infrastructure.
* **`docs/`:** Comprehensive documentation covering architecture, DevOps pillars, setup guides, and more.

## CI/CD Pipeline Details

The project leverages **GitHub Actions** for its **Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)** pipelines, specifically designed for Python microservices and Docker image management. The workflows are structured for efficiency, reusability, and robust security integration.

### Key Workflows:

* **`.github/workflows/build-python-services.yml` (Main CI Workflow):**
    * **Trigger:** Automatically runs on `push` events to `main`, `staging`, and `dev` branches.
    * **Optimized Builds:** Utilizes `dorny/paths-filter@v3` to detect changes in specific service directories (`src/event-audit-dashboard/`, `src/notification-service/`, `src/audit-log-analysis/`, `src/audit-event-generator/`).
    * **Conditional Execution:** Only triggers build and scan jobs for services that have undergone changes, optimizing pipeline execution time and resource usage.
    * **Reusable Workflow Calls:** Calls the `build-single-service.yml` reusable workflow for each modified service, passing necessary parameters like `service_name`, Docker credentials, and Git metadata.

* **`.github/workflows/build-single-service.yml` (Reusable Workflow):**
    * **Purpose:** Encapsulates the logic for building, pushing Docker images, and performing security scans for a *single* Python microservice. This promotes reusability and reduces duplication across multiple service pipelines.
    * **Inputs:** Requires `service_name`, `docker_org`, `docker_repo_prefix`, `ref_name` (branch name), `github_sha` (commit SHA), and Docker Hub credentials as secrets.
    * **Multi-architecture Builds:** Configured to build Docker images for `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` platforms, ensuring broad compatibility.
    * **Image Tagging:** Automatically generates Docker image tags based on the commit SHA, branch name (e.g., `main` gets `latest`, `dev` gets `dev`, `dev-snapshot`), and a combination of `docker_org` and `service_name`.
    * **Caching:** Uses GitHub Actions cache (`type=gha`) to speed up Docker image builds.

### Integrated Security Scans (DevSecOps):

Both workflows implicitly, via the reusable workflow, integrate security scanning at different stages of the CI/CD pipeline.

* **Static Application Security Testing (SAST):**
    * **Tool:** **Bandit** (`bandit -r . -ll -f sarif -o bandit_results.sarif`).
    * **Timing:** Runs *before* Docker image creation on the source code of each Python service.
    * **Output:** Generates SARIF format reports (`bandit_results.sarif`) which are then uploaded to **GitHub Code Scanning** (`github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3`) for centralized vulnerability management.
* **Software Composition Analysis (SCA) & Vulnerability Scanning:**
    * **Tool:** **Trivy** (`aquasecurity/trivy-action@master`).
    * **Types of Scans:**
        * **Filesystem Scan (`scan-type: 'fs'`):** Scans the project's dependencies (e.g., `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`) for known vulnerabilities (`vuln`) and secrets *before* image build.
        * **Image Scan (`image-ref`):** Scans the *built Docker image* for vulnerabilities in OS packages, programming language dependencies, and misconfigurations (`vuln,secret,misconfig`).
    * **Output:** Generates SARIF format reports (e.g., `trivy-dependency-results_*.sarif`, `trivy-image-results_*.sarif`) which are uploaded to **GitHub Code Scanning**, providing a comprehensive view of supply chain and image-level security.
    * **Non-Blocking:** Scans are configured with `exit-code: '0'` to avoid failing the build immediately, allowing security results to be collected even if issues are found, which can be reviewed in GitHub's security tab.

This robust CI/CD setup ensures that code changes are continuously integrated, built into multi-architecture Docker images, and thoroughly scanned for security vulnerabilities before deployment.

## Kubernetes Base Configuration Details (k8s/base) ☸️

The `k8s/base` directory contains the foundational Kubernetes YAML manifests for the **AuditFlow Platform's microservices** and their supporting infrastructure (PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, Redis). These files provide the core, un-customized declarations for Deployments, Services, StatefulSets, and PersistentVolumeClaims. While `k8s/charts` and `k8s/overlays` are planned for future development to handle templating and environment-specific customizations, `k8s/base` serves as the initial, declarative setup.

### Core Principles and Object Types:

* **Deployments**: Define and manage the desired state for the application microservices (e.g., `audit-event-generator`, `audit-log-analysis`, `event-audit-dashboard`, `notification-service`), ensuring a specified number of replicas are running.
* **Services**:
    * **`ClusterIP`**: Used for internal communication between services within the Kubernetes cluster. Most application and infrastructure services (e.g., `rabbitmq-service`, `postgres-service`, `audit-log-analysis-service`) are exposed via `ClusterIP`.
    * **`NodePort`**: The `event-audit-dashboard-service` is exposed as a `NodePort` (specifically `30080`), allowing external access to the dashboard via any Kubernetes node's IP address.
* **StatefulSets**: Used for stateful applications like PostgreSQL, ensuring stable network identities and ordered, graceful deployment/scaling.
* **PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs)**: Request and manage persistent storage for stateful applications (e.g., `postgres-pv-claim` for PostgreSQL), ensuring data durability across pod restarts or redeployments. Uses the `local-path` storage class, typical for K3s local storage.
* **Resource Management**: All Deployments include `requests` and `limits` for CPU and Memory, promoting efficient resource utilization and preventing resource contention.
* **Health Checks**: **Liveness and Readiness Probes** are configured for critical application services, enhancing resilience by ensuring Kubernetes routes traffic only to healthy, ready instances and restarts unhealthy ones.
* **Environment Variables**: Service-to-service communication configurations (like `RABBITMQ_HOST`, `REDIS_HOST`, `PG_HOST`) are injected into containers via environment variables, referencing the internal Kubernetes service names.
* **Secret Management**: Sensitive information, such as PostgreSQL database credentials (`PG_DB`, `PG_USER`, `PG_PASSWORD`), is securely referenced from a **Kubernetes Secret** (e.g., `postgres-credentials`), adhering to security best practices.
* **Observability Hooks**: Services include specific labels (`prometheus_scrape: "true"`) and annotations (`prometheus.io/scrape`, `prometheus.io/port`) to facilitate automatic discovery and scraping of metrics by **Prometheus**, indicating a strong focus on monitoring.

***
### Components in `k8s/base`:

* **`audit-event-generator`**: Deployment and ClusterIP Service. Generates events and connects to RabbitMQ.
* **`audit-log-analysis`**: Deployment and ClusterIP Service. Consumes events from RabbitMQ and interacts with Redis.
* **`event-audit-dashboard`**: Deployment and NodePort Service. Provides the web UI and connects to the Notification Service.
* **`notification-service`**: Deployment and ClusterIP Service. Handles alerts, connects to RabbitMQ and PostgreSQL. Securely retrieves PostgreSQL credentials from a Secret.
* **`postgres`**: PersistentVolumeClaim, ClusterIP Service, and StatefulSet. Provides a durable PostgreSQL database instance.
* **`rabbitmq`**: Deployment and ClusterIP Service. Acts as the central message broker for inter-service communication.
* **`redis`**: Deployment and ClusterIP Service. Serves as a key-value store, currently configured with `emptyDir` for non-persistent storage.

---
## Monitoring & Observability Strategy 📈
Currently, the primary focus for observability is on Prometheus metrics scraping, indicated by labels and annotations in the Kubernetes base manifests. Each Python microservice is expected to expose a `/metrics` endpoint (e.g., on port 8000 or 8001) for Prometheus to collect time-series data.

**Future Enhancements (Planned/To Be Detailed):**
* **Logging Strategy:** Details on structured logging, centralized log aggregation (e.g., ELK stack, Grafana Loki), and the implementation of correlation IDs for tracing requests across services are planned.
* **Alerting:** Configuration for Prometheus Alertmanager rules and notification channels will be added.
* **Distributed Tracing:** Future consideration for implementing distributed tracing (e.g., OpenTelemetry, Jaeger) to visualize inter-service request flows.

---

## Error Handling & Resilience Patterns 🛡️
As a microservices architecture, the system's resilience is critical. While specific patterns like retries and circuit breakers are not explicitly detailed in the current configuration files, these are essential considerations for a robust distributed system.

**Future Enhancements (Planned/To Be Detailed):**
* **Inter-service Communication Failures:** Specific strategies for handling transient network errors, including retries with exponential backoff.
* **Circuit Breakers/Bulkheads:** Implementation details for these patterns to prevent cascading failures.
* **Graceful Degradation:** How the system will behave when dependent services are unavailable.
* **Database Error Handling:** Mechanisms for managing database connection errors, transaction failures, and retries.

---

## API Endpoints & Communication Protocols 🔗
The core inter-service communication relies heavily on **RabbitMQ** for an event-driven architecture, enabling asynchronous message exchange between components.

**Current Knowns:**
* **Internal Communication:** Services communicate via RabbitMQ queues (e.g., `audit_events`, `audit_alerts`).
* **RESTful APIs:** The `event-audit-dashboard` is a web application, implying it exposes HTTP endpoints, and the `notification-service` is noted to have a future API (port 8000).

**Future Enhancements (Planned/To Be Detailed):**
* **Detailed API Endpoints:** Specific RESTful API endpoints exposed by services, their methods, and expected request/response formats.
* **API Documentation:** Whether OpenAPI/Swagger definitions are used or planned for internal/external APIs.
* **Other Protocols:** If other communication protocols (e.g., gRPC) are used for specific inter-service interactions.

---

## Deployment Strategy & Rollbacks 🔄
The deployment process relies on GitHub Actions for building Docker images and a Kubernetes base configuration `(k8s/base)` for defining the desired state.

**Current Knowns:**
* **Initial Deployment:** Based on the `infra/terraform` and `infra/ansible` details, the initial infrastructure provisioning and K3s cluster setup are automated. Application deployment is via direct application of `k8s/base` manifests, or conceptually via Helm (once `k8s/charts` is populated).
* **Rolling Updates:** Kubernetes Deployments, by default, employ a rolling update strategy when `replicas` are updated or the `template` changes.

**Future Enhancements (Planned/To Be Detailed):**
* **Automated Rollback Mechanism:** Specific strategies and tooling (e.g., leveraging Helm's rollback capabilities) for quickly reverting to a previous stable version in case of a failed deployment.
* **Canary Deployments/Blue-Green Deployments:** Advanced deployment strategies for minimizing risk during new releases.
* **Traffic Management:** How ingress controllers, service meshes, or other tools manage traffic during deployments or for A/B testing.

---

## Database Schema & Migrations 🗄️
The database schema and any updates are currently managed directly within the **application codebase** of the services that interact with PostgreSQL (primarily the `notification-service`). There is no separate database migration tool (like Alembic, Flyway, or Liquibase) explicitly mentioned or configured at this stage.

**Further Understanding:** To understand the specific schema and its evolution, a review of the database interaction code within the relevant application services (e.g., ORM models, SQL statements) would be necessary.

## 🧪 Testing Philosophy & Strategy Summary

Our approach to unit and integration testing is guided by practical experience, long-term maintainability, and insights from the broader development community. Here’s a summary of key takeaways and how they shape our testing practices:

---

### 🔹 General Guidelines

- **No arbitrary coverage targets** (e.g. 100%) — coverage is not a guarantee of quality.
- Focus on **high-value coverage**: business logic, edge cases, data validation, and workflows with real-world consequences.
- Prioritize **breadth over depth**: it's better to have all files partially tested than a few files exhaustively covered.

---

### 🔹 Unit Testing

- Use unit tests to verify **core logic**, **critical transformations**, and **small testable functions**.
- Avoid over-testing trivial code (getters, boilerplate, etc.).
- Keep tests meaningful and easy to understand — they should explain what the code does and catch regressions early.

---

### 🔹 Integration Testing

- Integration tests simulate how components interact under real conditions.
- Ideal for:
  - HTTP routes and controllers
  - Database interactions
  - Service boundaries
- Integration tests often provide more realistic coverage than isolated unit tests.

---

### 🔹 On Test-Driven Development (TDD)

- TDD can help guide design and ensure correctness, especially in complex or evolving modules.
- However, strict TDD can lead to **test bloat** and **poor design** when followed dogmatically.
- Use it **when it adds value**, not as a mandatory rule.

---

### 🔹 Coverage Philosophy

- **Test what matters**, not just what exists.
- Treat coverage as a **feedback tool**, not a goal.
- Use integration and system tests to validate behavior from the user's point of view.
- Maintain tests that **prevent regressions**, not tests that just exercise lines of code.

---

### 🧠 Summary Quote

> “The right number of tests is not a number — it's the set of tests that gives you confidence to ship and change code safely.”
