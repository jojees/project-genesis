## 1. Chart Overview

The `auditflow-platform` Helm chart (`k8s/charts/auditflow-platform/`) serves as the central **umbrella chart** for the entire AuditFlow Platform. Its primary purpose is to aggregate and manage the deployment of all application microservices (e.g., `audit-event-generator`, `notification-service`) and their core infrastructure dependencies (e.g., PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, Redis) as a single, cohesive unit within a Kubernetes cluster.

This umbrella chart simplifies complex deployments by:
* Defining all platform components in one place.
* Managing inter-component dependencies.
* Providing a single configurable interface (`values.yaml`) for the entire stack.
* Enabling reproducible and version-controlled deployments.

## 2. Chart Directory Structure

The `auditflow-platform` chart follows a standard Helm chart structure, with key directories and files. Note the location of `values-dev.yaml` which is external to the main chart's directory but used for environment-specific overrides.
```
k8s/
├── charts/
│   ├── auditflow-platform/             # Main umbrella chart directory
│   │   ├── Chart.yaml                  # Chart metadata and dependencies

│   └── values-dev.yaml                 # Environment-specific overrides for 'dev' environment
```

## 3. `Chart.yaml` - The Blueprint

The `Chart.yaml` file is the heart of the umbrella chart, defining its identity and, most importantly, its dependencies.

* **Metadata:**
    ```yaml
    # k8s/charts/auditflow-platform/Chart.yaml
    apiVersion: v2
    name: auditflow-platform
    description: A Helm chart for deploying the entire AuditFlow Platform microservices and dependencies.
    type: application
    version: 0.1.0
    appVersion: 0.1.0
    ```
    This section declares the chart's name, versioning, and a brief description.

* **Dependencies:** This crucial section lists all subcharts that comprise the AuditFlow Platform.
    ```yaml
    # k8s/charts/auditflow-platform/Chart.yaml (excerpt)
    dependencies:
      - name: audit-event-generator
        version: "0.1.0"
        repository: "file://charts/audit-event-generator" # Local path
        condition: audit-event-generator.enabled
      - name: audit-log-analysis
        version: "0.1.0"
        repository: "file://charts/audit-log-analysis" # Local path
        condition: audit-log-analysis.enabled
      - name: notification-service
        version: "0.1.0"
        repository: "file://charts/notification-service" # Local path
        condition: notification-service.enabled
      - name: event-audit-dashboard
        version: "0.1.0"
        repository: "file://charts/event-audit-dashboard" # Local path
        condition: event-audit-dashboard.enabled
      - name: postgresql
        version: "13.2.29"
        repository: "[https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami](https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami)" # Remote repository
        condition: postgresql.enabled
      - name: rabbitmq
        version: "12.1.0"
        repository: "[https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami](https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami)" # Remote repository
        condition: rabbitmq.enabled
      - name: redis
        version: "18.16.0"
        repository: "[https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami](https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami)" # Remote repository
        condition: redis.enabled
      - name: external-secrets
        version: "0.9.1"
        repository: "[https://charts.external-secrets.io](https://charts.external-secrets.io)" # Remote repository
        condition: external-secrets.enabled
        alias: eso # Alias for clarity
    ```
    * **`name`**: The name of the dependent chart.
    * **`version`**: The specific version of the dependent chart to use, ensuring reproducible builds.
    * **`repository`**: Specifies the source of the chart. `file://charts/<chart-name>` is used for local subcharts, while full URLs point to remote Helm repositories (e.g., Bitnami, External Secrets Operator).
    * **`condition`**: A powerful feature that allows enabling or disabling a subchart based on a boolean value in the parent chart's `values.yaml`. This provides flexibility to deploy only a subset of the platform.

## 4. `values.yaml` - The Configuration Interface

The `values.yaml` file at the root of `auditflow-platform` (`k8s/charts/auditflow-platform/values.yaml`) serves as the primary configuration entry point for the entire platform. It defines default values that can be overridden at deployment time.

* **Enabling/Disabling Components:** Each subchart listed in `Chart.yaml`'s `dependencies` section has a corresponding top-level key in `values.yaml` with an `enabled` field.
    ```yaml
    # k8s/charts/auditflow-platform/values.yaml (excerpt)
    audit-event-generator:
      enabled: true
    audit-log-analysis:
      enabled: true
    notification-service:
      enabled: true
    event-audit-dashboard:
      enabled: true
    postgresql:
      enabled: true
    rabbitmq:
      enabled: true
    redis:
      enabled: true
    external-secrets:
      enabled: true
    ```

* **Passing Configuration to Subcharts:** Values defined under a subchart's key in the parent `values.yaml` are automatically passed down to that subchart. This allows for centralized configuration management.
    ```yaml
    # k8s/charts/auditflow-platform/values.yaml (excerpt)
    notification-service:
      replicaCount: 2 # Overrides default in notification-service/values.yaml
      image:
        tag: "v1.0.1-stable"
      postgresql: # Values specific to notification-service's PostgreSQL dependency
        auth:
          username: "audituser"
          database: "alerts_db"
        port: 5432
      waitFor: # Init container dependencies
        - name: postgresql
          port: 5432
        - name: rabbitmq
          port: 5672

    postgresql: # Direct configuration for the Bitnami PostgreSQL subchart
      auth:
        username: "audituser"
        database: "alerts_db"
        # password is handled by secrets.yaml and ESO
      primary:
        persistence:
          enabled: true
          storageClass: "local-path"
          size: "5Gi"
    ```

### Environment-Specific Overrides

To manage configurations for different environments (e.g., `dev`, `staging`, `production`), separate `values.yaml` files are used. These files can be placed alongside the main chart or in a dedicated `environments/` subdirectory within the chart.

For instance, your `k8s/charts/values-dev.yaml` file provides overrides specifically for the `dev` environment. This file typically contains settings like image tags for development builds or specific configurations for non-production dependencies (e.g., disabling Redis authentication for local testing).

**Example `k8s/charts/values-dev.yaml`:**

```yaml
# k8s/charts/values-dev.yaml

audit-event-generator:
  enabled: true
  image:
    tag: dev
audit-log-analysis:
  enabled: true
  image:
    tag: dev
notification-service:
  enabled: true
  image:
    tag: dev
event-audit-dashboard:
  enabled: true
  image:
    tag: dev

redis:
  auth:
    enabled: false
    # These two lines are crucial to override the Bitnami chart's security defaults
    password: "" 
    allowEmptyPassword: yes 
```

During deployment, these files are layered using multiple `-f` flags, with values from later files overriding those from earlier ones. This allows for a clean separation of environment-specific settings from the chart's defaults.

```bash
# Example deployment command using environment-specific values
# Assuming you are running this command from the 'k8s/charts/' directory
helm install afp auditflow-platform/ --namespace dev --create-namespace \
  -f auditflow-platform/secrets.yaml \
  -f values-dev.yaml
```

## 5. Subchart Management
The `auditflow-platform` chart effectively manages two types of subcharts:

### Local Application Subcharts
These are your custom microservices, developed as independent Helm charts within the `charts/` subdirectory of the umbrella chart (e.g., `charts/audit-event-generator`). They contain their own `Chart.yaml`, `values.yaml`, and Kubernetes manifests (`deployment.yaml`, `service.yaml`).

### Remote Infrastructure Subcharts
These are third-party charts fetched from public Helm repositories, such as Bitnami for PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, and Redis, and the External Secrets Operator chart. When `helm dependency update` is run, these charts are downloaded and packaged as `.tgz` files into the `charts/` directory.

### Value Flow to Subcharts
Helm automatically passes configuration values from the parent `auditflow-platform` chart to its subcharts. Any key in the parent's `values.yaml` that matches the `name` of a subchart will have its values passed to that subchart. For example, values defined under `postgresql:` in the umbrella chart's `values.yaml` will override the defaults in the Bitnami PostgreSQL chart's `values.yaml`.

## 6. Templating and Custom Logic
Helm leverages Go templating to dynamically generate Kubernetes manifests from the chart's templates and values.

`templates/_helpers.tpl` **- Consistency Enforcer**

This file is crucial for maintaining consistency across the entire platform. It contains reusable Go template functions (partials) that define common naming conventions and labels.
    * `auditflow-platform.fullname`: Generates a consistent full name for resources, typically combining the release name and chart name, ensuring Kubernetes DNS compatibility.
    * `auditflow-platform.labels`: Defines standard Kubernetes labels (`app.kubernetes.io/name`, `helm.sh/chart`, `app.kubernetes.io/instance`, etc.) applied to all resources for easy identification and management.
    * `auditflow-platform.selectorLabels`: Defines a subset of labels used specifically for Kubernetes selectors (e.g., in Deployments and Services) to match pods.

These helpers are `included` in various templates to ensure uniformity and reduce boilerplate.

### Custom Init Container: `afp-wait-for`
A notable custom helper is `afp-wait-for`, which generates an `initContainer` to ensure service dependencies are ready before the main application container starts. This prevents "crash loop backoff" scenarios.

* **Purpose:** This `initContainer` uses nslookup to verify DNS resolution and `netcat` (`nc`) to check port reachability for dependent services (e.g., RabbitMQ, PostgreSQL, Redis).
* **Usage Example (from a subchart's `deployment.yaml`):**

```yaml
# Example snippet from notification-service/templates/deployment.yaml
initContainers:
{{- range .Values.waitFor }}
{{ include "afp-wait-for" (dict "Name" .name "Port" .port "Context" $) | nindent 6 }}
{{- end }}
```
This loop iterates through a list of dependencies defined in the subchart's `values.yaml` (`.Values.waitFor`), generating a `busybox` init container for each. The `afp-wait-for.command` helper (defined in `_helpers.tpl`) constructs the actual `nslookup` and `nc` commands.

### Standard Kubernetes Manifests
Within each application subchart's `templates/` directory, you'll find standard Kubernetes resource definitions like:

* `deployment.yaml`: Defines the `Deployment` for managing application pods, including image, replica count, environment variables, resource requests/limits, and liveness/readiness probes. All these values are templated from the subchart's `values.yaml`.
* `service.yaml`: Defines the Service resource, typically of `ClusterIP` type for internal communication, or `NodePort` (for `event-audit-dashboard`) to expose the application within the cluster.

## 7. Helm Testing Integration
The Helm chart integrates testing capabilities using Helm's built-in `helm test` feature. This involves defining Kubernetes `Job` resources within the `templates/tests/` subdirectory of a subchart, annotated with `"helm.sh/hook": test`.

* **Purpose:** These tests run post-installation to validate:
    * Basic deployment success.
    * Network connectivity to dependent services (e.g., `notification-service` connecting to PostgreSQL and RabbitMQ).
    * Correct application of configuration values.
* **Example:** A `test-postgresql-connection.yaml` might be placed in `notification-service/templates/tests/` to verify database connectivity.
* **Execution:** After deployment, tests are run using `helm test <release-name> --namespace <your-namespace>`.

## 8. Helm Deployment Workflow
The typical workflow for deploying the AuditFlow Platform using this Helm chart involves:

1. **Navigate to Chart Directory:** `cd k8s/charts/auditflow-platform/`

2. **Ensure Secrets are Encrypted:** Verify `secrets.yaml` is populated and encrypted with SOPS.

3. **Update Dependencies:** `helm dependency update .` to fetch/update all subcharts.

4. **Dry Run (Validation):** `helm install <release-name> . --namespace <your-namespace> --dry-run --debug -f secrets.yaml -f environments/<your-env>-values.yaml` to inspect generated manifests.

5. **Install/Upgrade:** `helm install <release-name> . --namespace <your-namespace> --create-namespace -f secrets.yaml -f environments/<your-env>-values.yaml` (or `helm upgrade`).

6. **Run Helm Tests:** `helm test <release-name> --namespace <your-namespace>` to validate the deployed application.

## 9. Conclusion
The `auditflow-platform` Helm chart is designed as a robust and flexible solution for deploying the AuditFlow Platform. By leveraging an umbrella chart structure, comprehensive `values.yaml` for configuration, custom templating helpers, and integrated testing, it provides a streamlined and reproducible deployment experience. This design promotes modularity, maintainability, and aligns with modern Kubernetes best practices for managing complex microservice applications.
