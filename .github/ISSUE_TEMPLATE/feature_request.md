### Is your feature request related to a problem?

Describe the problem you're trying to solve with this feature. What are the current limitations or pain points?

*Example: "As an administrator, I currently have to manually restart services after a configuration change, which is disruptive."*

---

### Describe the Solution You'd Like

Provide a clear and concise description of what you want to happen. Be specific about the desired behavior and any new components or integrations.

*Example: "I would like the Configuration Service to automatically detect and apply changes from ConfigMaps without requiring a pod restart, potentially via a webhook or in-app refresh logic."*

### Describe Alternatives You've Considered

Have you thought about any alternative solutions or workarounds? If so, please describe them and explain why they are not ideal.

*Example: "Currently, we manually `kubectl apply` new ConfigMaps and then `kubectl rollout restart deployment` for the affected services. This works but causes brief downtime."*

---

### Business Value / Use Case

Explain why this feature is valuable to the AuditFlow Platform. What specific use cases does it enable, or what benefit does it provide to users/operations?

*Example: "This feature would reduce downtime during configuration updates, improve operational efficiency, and make the platform more resilient to frequent changes."*

### Technical Considerations (Optional)
